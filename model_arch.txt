1-States:
*Each state represents a specific behavioral pattern or sequence observed in malware samples
*States are defined based on extracted features such as opcode sequences, system calls, API calls, file system activity, and network traffic patterns.
The number of states is determined based on the complexity of malware behaviors and can be adjusted based on experimentation and domain knowledge.
2-Initial State Probabilities:
*Initial probabilities represent the likelihood of the model starting in each state
*These probabilities can be estimated based on the relative frequency of occurrence of different states in the training data.
3-Transition Probabilities:
*Transition probabilities determine the likelihood of transitioning from one state to another in the model.
*Captures the temporal dependencies between different malware behaviors.
*Learned from the training data using algorithms like the Baum-Welch algorithm (Forward-Backward algorithm).
4-Emission Probabilities:
*Emission probabilities represent the likelihood of observing specific features (emissions) given the model's current state.
*Learned from the training data and capture the probability distribution of features under each state.
Training Algorithm:
*Baum-Welch algorithm (Forward-Backward algorithm) for parameter estimation.
*Estimate model parameters (transition and emission probabilities) from the training data iteratively until convergence
6-Classification Algorithm:
*Use the Viterbi algorithm to find the most likely sequence of states given a sequence of observed features during classification.
*Assign class labels based on the most likely sequence of states or probabilities associated with each class.
7-Evaluation Metrics:
*(choosing it later)
*Assess the model's ability to accurately classify malware samples compared to known classifications
8-Refinement Mechanism:
*Refine the model iteratively based on performance metrics
*Adjust the number of states, incorporate additional features, fine-tune parameters, or explore alternative algorithms to improve classification accuracy.
